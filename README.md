# Bevy in a dev container
To keep host clean by running bevy in a vscode `.devcontainer`
Forward x11 and uses [nvida container-toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html) to forward gpu
Might try doing a software-only version once this works to support codespaces.
